A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (called a "node") contains:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data: The value of the node.
Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
Unlike arrays, elements in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node points to the next, forming a chain of nodes.


Types of Linked Lists:
----------------------
1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to null.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.


Singly Linked List Implementation in JavaScript:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Node Structure:
Each node has two parts:
value: Stores the data.
next: Stores the reference to the next node (initially null).

2. Linked List Structure:
A head pointer to the first node.
A tail pointer to the last node (optional, for efficient tail operations).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Operations in a Singly Linked List:
---------------------------------------

1. Append: Add a node to the end of the list.
Time Complexity: O(n) (needs to traverse the entire list).

2. Prepend: Add a node to the beginning of the list.
Time Complexity: O(1) (no traversal needed).

3. Remove: Remove a node by value.
Time Complexity: O(n) (requires traversal to find the node).

4. Search: Traverse the list to find an element.
Time Complexity: O(n).

5. Print List: Print all elements in the list by traversing it.


Advantages of Linked Lists:
---------------------------
Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, unlike arrays, which have a fixed size.
Efficient insertions/deletions: Insertions and deletions are efficient compared to arrays, especially for 
large datasets where shifting elements is costly.

Disadvantages of Linked Lists:
-------------------------------
Memory overhead: Each node requires additional memory to store the next reference.
No random access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not allow random access to elements, making lookups slower (O(n)).

Doubly Linked List Operations:
------------------------------
Forward traversal: Starts from the head.
Backward traversal: Starts from the tail.

Key Operations in a Circular Linked List:
-----------------------------------------
1. Append: Add a new node to the end of the list. The new tail points to the head.
Time Complexity: O(1) if tail is tracked, O(n) otherwise (to traverse to the end).

2. Remove: Remove a node from the list, adjusting the links to maintain the circular structure.
Time Complexity: O(n) (requires traversal).

3. Traversal: You can start at any node and follow the next pointers in a circular fashion.
Time Complexity: O(n).

4. Contains/Search: Traverse the list to find if a value exists.
Time Complexity: O(n).

Key Points:
-------------
1. Circular nature: In a circular linked list, the last node links back to the first node, creating a continuous 
loop.No null references: Unlike singly or doubly linked lists, the next reference in the last node points to the head, 
not null.
2. Traversal: You must be careful to stop traversal at the appropriate point, as there's no natural "end" (i.e., null).

Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
------------------------------------
1. Efficient traversal: Starting from any node, you can visit all nodes in a continuous loop.
2. Efficient use of memory: Suitable for applications where continuous cycling of data is needed 
(e.g., round-robin scheduling).

Use Cases:
-------------
Round-robin scheduling: In operating systems, tasks are scheduled in a circular fashion.
Circular buffers: Useful in scenarios like implementing a queue with fixed size or cyclic buffers in networking.

Comparison with Other Linked Lists:
-----------------------------------
Singly Linked List: The last node points to null (linear structure).
Doubly Linked List: Each node has pointers to both previous and next nodes, allowing bidirectional traversal.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, allowing continuous traversal.
