Strings in JavaScript are sequences of characters enclosed within quotation marks. 
They can be created using either single or double quotes:
---------------------------------

const str1 = "Hello, world!";
const str2 = 'This is a string';

-----------------------------------

Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. 
Any operations that modify strings create new strings.
